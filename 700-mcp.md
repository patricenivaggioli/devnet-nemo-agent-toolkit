# 7. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

This lab demonstrates how to integrate the NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) servers. You'll learn to use remote tools through MCP and publish Agent toolkit functions as MCP services.

You can run the simple calculator workflow using Remote MCP tools. In this case, the workflow acts as a MCP client and connects to the MCP server running on the specified URL. Details are provided in the [MCP Client Guide](../../../docs/source/workflows/mcp/mcp-client.md).

NeMo Agent toolkit enables workflows to use MCP tools as functions. The library handles the MCP server connection, tool discovery, and function registration. This allows the workflow to use MCP tools as regular functions.

## 7.1 Prerequisites

Install the packages required to run the workflow and MCP server.

```bash
cd ~/nemo-agent-toolkit/
uv pip install -e examples/MCP/simple_calculator_mcp
```

## 7.2 Check the MCP tools

The tools for the `simple_calculator` are defined in the `register.py` file:

```bash
cd ~/nemo-agent-toolkit/
cat examples/getting_started/simple_calculator/src/nat_simple_calculator/register.py 
```

You should have the following output:

```

## 7.3 Launch the MCP server

Start the remote MCP server with:

```bash
nat mcp serve --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_calculator/configs/config.yml
```

This starts an MCP server on port 9901 with endpoint `/mcp` and uses `streamable-http` transport. See the [MCP Server](../../../docs/source/workflows/mcp/mcp-server.md) documentation for more information.

## 7.4 Check the Workflow configuration

The workflow configuration is defined with the `config.yml` file.

This configuration creates two function groups:

- `mcp_time`: Connects to a local MCP server using stdio transport to get current date and time
- `mcp_math`: Connects to a remote MCP server using streamable-http transport to access calculator tools

Check the configuration file

```bash
cd ~/nemo-agent-toolkit/
cat examples/MCP/simple_calculator_mcp/configs/config-mcp-client-azure.yml
```

You should have the following output:

## 7.5 Run the Workflow

Open a new terminal and activate the virtual environment

```bash
cd ~/nemo-agent-toolkit/
source .venv/bin/activate
```

and run the workflow

```bash
nat run --config_file=examples/MCP/simple_calculator_mcp/configs/config-mcp-client-azure.yml --input "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"
```
