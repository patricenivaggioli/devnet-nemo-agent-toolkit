# This config file shows how to use the MCP server to get the current date and time.
# Here the workflow acts as a MCP client and connects to the MCP server running
# on the specified URL. streamable-http is the recommended transport for HTTP-based
# connections, but sse is also supported for backwards compatibility.

# This config file shows -
# 1. how to use a local MCP server to get the current date and time using stdio transport.
# 2. how to access a remote MCP server using streamable-http transport for math operations.
#
# As the mcp_server_time is running locally ensure that the package "mcp_server_time" is installed
# on your local machine. For example, if you are using pip, you can install it with:
# uv pip install mcp-server-time
